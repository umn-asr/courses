{"name":"UMN Course/Class Data Service","tagline":"","body":"# courses.umn.edu\r\n\r\nA JSON/XML service for getting University of Minnesota course and class data. Works for all campuses. Searchable. Up to date.\r\n\r\n*Note* this is still under active development. The links below will work, but our demo site only contains 2 courses' worth of data.\r\n\r\n## Getting Courses\r\n\r\nYou must include a Campus and Term. The format is:\r\n\r\n`https://courses-staging.umn.edu/campuses/[campus abbreviation]/terms/[strm]/courses.json`\r\n\r\nor, if you want XML:\r\n\r\n`https://courses-staging.umn.edu/campuses/[campus abbreviation]/terms/[strm]/courses.xml`\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n- https://courses-staging.umn.edu/campuses/umntc/terms/1149/courses.json\r\n- https://courses-staging.umn.edu/campuses/umnro/terms/1153/courses.xml\r\n\r\n## Searching\r\n\r\nSearch for courses by using the query string. You can search by:\r\n\r\n- Subject\r\n- Catalog Number\r\n- Liberal Education \r\n- Instruction Mode\r\n- Location\r\n\r\nSearching works with both JSON and XML output.\r\n\r\nAll of these searches can be combined, as we'll see in the examples.\r\n\r\n### Subject\r\n\r\nFinding courses under one subject:\r\n\r\n`courses.json?q=subject_id=HIST`\r\n\r\nThis will return all courses with the subject of HIST.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFinding courses under many subjects:\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=subject_id=HIST|PHYS`\r\n\r\nReturns all courses with a subject of HIST or PHYS. You can have as many subjects as you want, just separate them with a |.\r\n\r\n### Catalog Number\r\n\r\nFind a course with a specific catalog number\r\n\r\n`courses.json?q=catalog_number=1101W`\r\n\r\nReturns all courses with a catalog number of '1101W'.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFind a course with a catalog number higher than a value:\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=catalog_number>1000`\r\n\r\nReturns all courses with a catalog number higher than 1000. \r\n\r\nYou can also do `>=` to return courses with a catalog number higher than or equal to 1000\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFind a course with a catalog number less than a value:\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=catalog_number<5000`\r\n\r\nReturns all courses with a catalog number less than 1000. \r\n\r\nYou can also do `<=` to return courses with a catalog number less than or equal to 1000\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFind courses with a catalog number in a range of values:\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=catalog_number>=1000,catalog_number<5000`\r\n\r\nReturns all courses with a catalog_number greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 5000\r\n\r\n### Liberal Education\r\n\r\nGet courses that are Writing Intensive\r\n\r\n`courses.json?q=cle_attribute_id=WI`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGet courses that meet Civic Life or Historical Perspectives\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=cle_attribute_id=HIS|CIV`\r\n\r\n### Instruction Mode\r\n\r\nYou can search using any of these Instruction Mode abbreviations:\r\n\r\n\r\n- P: In Person, Term Based\r\n- ID: Independent/Directed Study\r\n- CE: Online Distance Learning\r\n- PA: Partially Online\r\n- CO: Completely Online\r\n- PR: Primarily Online\r\n\r\nGet courses that are Partially Online\r\n\r\n`courses.json?q=instruction_mode_id=PA`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nGet courses that are Partially Online or Primarily Online\r\n\r\n`courses.xml?q=instruction_mode_id=PA|PR`\r\n\r\n### Combining Searches\r\n\r\nAny of the searches can be combined. For example\r\n\r\n`courses.json?q=cle_attribute_id=WI,instruction_mode_id=P,catalog_number>=2000,catalog_number<3000,subject_id=HIST`\r\n\r\nWill return any courses that are:\r\n\r\n- Writing Intensive\r\n- Taught In Person\r\n- With a catalog number between 2000 and 2999\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
